Collaborative Editing Prototype
===============================

A simple example of realtime collaborative editing of geospatial content using
Leaflet, Mapbox.js, node.js and Socket.IO.

Installing
----------

1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) in whatever manner you wish. As long
   as you can execute both `nodejs` and `npm` commands.
2. Install Socket.IO: `npm install socket.io`.

Running
-------

Once you have node.js and Socket.IO running you can run the example by:

    nodejs server.js

Now you should be able to load http://localhost:8000 into as many browser
windows as you wish.
